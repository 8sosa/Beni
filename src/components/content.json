            "Quite a significant number of professionals now assume that with innovative AI tools, copywriters’ jobs will be wiped away. They posit that better copies are churned out in minutes by these tools. AIs, even with artificial human intelligence, will continue to be a form of machine learning. Business interactions, whether B2B or B2C will always require human intelligence.",

Human behavioral psychology is highly dynamic, and what is accurate one day may change the next. Artificial intelligence can help the copywriter overcome mental block and occasional lack of inspiration. It requires the human mind to navigate it towards maximum output.",
            "Yes, AI is an important tool and performs extremely well in the hands of people who are mastering its application in various ways. It can be used to track buying behavior but unable to execute real-time changes and shifts that are human nature."
